# DebugSocket

A unix domain socket that listens for debug commands.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/square/debug_socket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/square/debug_socket)

## Warning

Anything sent to the unix domain socket will be passed to `eval()`. Be careful.
Security-wise, this is OK: the debug socket is restricted to the process owner.
The socket permissions are 0600, so only the user running the process can
connect to the socket. The user that is running the process can also attach GDB
to the running process and do the same things the socket allows, only it won't
be memory safe ;).


## Usage

A rails example with puma and sidekiq:

in `config/puma.rb`

```ruby
on_worker_boot do
  DebugSocket.logger = Rails.logger
  DebugSocket.start(Rails.root.join("tmp", "puma-debug-#{Process.pid}.sock"))
end

on_worker_shutdown do
  DebugSocket.stop
end
```

in `config/initializers/sidekiq.rb`

```ruby
Sidekiq.configure_server do |_config|
  DebugSocket.logger = Sidekiq::Logging.logger
  DebugSocket.start(Rails.root.join("tmp", "sidekiq-debug-#{Process.pid}.sock"))
  at_exit { DebugSocket.stop }
end
```

You can now send ruby instruction commands through the socket and they'll be
executed in your running process.  You can use `socat` to write and read
from the socket and dump to `stdout` like so:

```
% echo backtrace | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:~/tmp/puma-debug-1234.sock
2016-08-09T00:51:57Z puma: cluster worker 0: 1234
2016-08-09T00:51:57Z pid=1234 thread.object_id=70099243629020 thread.status=run
lib/debug_socket.rb:55:in `backtrace'
lib/debug_socket.rb:55:in `block in backtrace'
lib/debug_socket.rb:54:in `map'
lib/debug_socket.rb:54:in `backtrace'
spec/debug_socket_spec.rb:48:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'

2016-08-09T00:51:57Z pid=1234 thread.object_id=70121809360520 thread.status=sleep
spec/debug_socket_spec.rb:48:in `sleep'
spec/debug_socket_spec.rb:48:in `block (4 levels) in <top (required)>'
```

The gem also provides a helper script that wraps the above command.  The
`debug-socket` script takes one argument, the path to the unix socket, and it
will run the `backtrace` command through that socket.

```
% debug-socket ~/tmp/puma-debug-1234.sock
2016-08-09T00:51:57Z puma: cluster worker 0: 1234
2016-08-09T00:51:57Z pid=1234 thread.object_id=70099243629020 thread.status=run
lib/debug_socket.rb:55:in `backtrace'
lib/debug_socket.rb:55:in `block in backtrace'
lib/debug_socket.rb:54:in `map'
lib/debug_socket.rb:54:in `backtrace'
spec/debug_socket_spec.rb:48:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'

2016-08-09T00:51:57Z pid=1234 thread.object_id=70121809360520 thread.status=sleep
spec/debug_socket_spec.rb:48:in `sleep'
spec/debug_socket_spec.rb:48:in `block (4 levels) in <top (required)>'
```
